Summary: An introduction to the new webpage.

In preparation of the upcoming first release of the ZeroBin fork under the new name, we have set up this little project website. Its intended to be updated mostly with release announcements and some intermediate updates such as this one.

The release has now all the features we thought necessary to include. Currently we are in some final testing rounds and plan to have a the release ready before the end of August.

Cheers,
