Summary: This is the first release of PrivateBin after renaming the ZeroBin fork.

<!-- short intro -->
**This is the first release of PrivateBin after renaming the ZeroBin fork. We decided to use the version number 1.0 for this release as we consider PrivateBin now very mature and feature complete. We recommend everyone to update as this version features many security improvements.**

<!-- reasons for renaming & new version-->
The renaming of ZeroBin to PrivateBin is done to highlight the huge developments (over 500 commits) which have happened since ZeroBin stopped being actively maintained by its original creator SÃ©bastien Sauvage in 2014. By choosing to release version 1.0 we also want to emphasize the many feature changes - according to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) - and want to show that PrivateBin is now considered mature. Hence a version number smaller than 1.0 just does not seem suitable for PrivateBin anymore.

## Update procedure
<!-- How to update from ZeroBin to PrivateBin? / What changes for server admins? -->

Make sure your system has some source for cryptographically safe random numbers! Either use PHP 7 or one of the supported fallbacks: [libsodium](https://paragonie.com/book/pecl-libsodium/read/00-intro.md#installing-libsodium), open_basedir access to `/dev/urandom`, mcrypt or com_dotnet. The previous workaround using `mt_rand()` was removed, as it leads to unsafe and predictable numbers.

Otherwise, as usual, only the files need to be updated. The `tmp` folder for the compiled RainTPL templates can be removed, since we switched to a more lightweight template approach due to RainTPL not being maintained anymore. Have a look at or [template documentation](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Templates) to learn how to upgrade your custom template to the new system.

There are some new options in the [configuration](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Configuration) file. If you are updating from an older ZeroBin install and want to keep existing pastes accessible, make sure to enable the option `zerobincompatibility`. Otherwise more secure settings are used which break compatibility with ZeroBin.

## Benefits of switching to the new release
<!-- What changes for server users? -->

As a user of a ZeroBin instance nothing changes. As soon as the server administrator upgrades to PrivateBin, you can continue using it. We took great efforts to ensure that existing pastes are still fully compatible with the current release.

Since version 0.22 we added a Slowene and Chinese translation, an (optional) URL shortener button, a preview tab to help you chose the right format for your content and many other small user interface improvements to make your life a bit more comfortable.

<!-- Why server admins should update -->
With this release we have improved the security of PrivateBin as we have now [addressed most concerns](https://privatebin.info/news/zerobin-audit.html) raised in a security audit of the original ZeroBin in 2014.

Furthermore we switched to AES Galois/Counter mode, which is considered a stronger encryption mode then the previously used AES Counter mode with CBC-MAC authentication. The main benefit here is that the authentication (as the pastes/comments are sent over network you want to ensure that your content is not accidentally or maliciously manipulated) is done on the encrypted text instead of the plain text. The potential parallelization of CCM could not be implemented in the single threaded Javascript environment of webbrowsers, anyway.

We also make use of a new browser security feature called [Content Security Policy](https://scotthelme.co.uk/content-security-policy-an-introduction/), which prevents [XSS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) in an effective way. It blocks any third party scripts and resources to be executed in the context of the application.

Additionally we started using the new subresource integrity ([SRI](http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/)) browser feature to avoid loading manipulated scripts under man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally this allows privacy aware users to easily check for manipulated scripts in the source code of the website and to compare them to the hashes of the official PrivateBin release of that version.

To ensure that PrivateBins code is of high quality we [added various code quality checkers](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/22) and subsequently improved the code. These analysers also helped us to [find some potential vulnerabilities](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/41).

If you have further questions or issues have a look at the new [FAQ](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/FAQ).
